## How to submit an issue

PEGAS is quite complex for a kOS script, and due to notorious difficulty in debugging anything in kOS (one has to run the entire ascent) it is not guaranteed to be completely free from bugs or errors.
I am willing to provide support and correct those bugs.
The best way to notify me about problems and receive help is via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Noiredd/PEGAS/issues).
Private messages on [forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com) or posts in my [development thread there](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142213-pegas-powered-explicit-guidance-ascent-system-devlog/) also work, although might be slower.

0. Make sure you are using the most recent release of PEGAS. Perhaps your problem was fixed in an update?
1. Check the [tutorial](tutorial.md) and [reference](reference.md) - maybe the answer is there already?
2. Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Noiredd/PEGAS/issues) - maybe I already know about the problem?
3. If not, make a new issue and describe what's wrong.
If you get an error message - what does it say?
If PEGAS crashes - when and how?
If PEGAS fails to get to orbit - provide as much info as you can: `vehicle`, `controls`, `sequence` and `mission` contents, `.craft` file - anything that would allow me to reproduce your issue.
4. If the problem requires attaching a `.craft` file, please try to strip it of as many mods as possible. I developed and tested PEGAS on a Realism Overhaul install with all of the necessary and many of the suggested mods, including:  
ASET Avionics  
Cryo Tanks  
Cryogenic Engines  
DMagic Orbital Science  
FASA  
Kerbal Attachment System  
KW Rocketry Rebalanced  
Near Future (most plugins)  
Procedural Fairings  
Procedural Parts  
Real Scale Boosters  
RemoteTech  
Salyut Stations  
SCANsat  
Soviet Probes  
Soviet Rockets  
Soviet Spacecraft  
TAC Life Support  
Taerobee  
Tantares  
Universal Storage II  
US Probes Pack  
US Rockets  
Ven's New Parts & Stock Part Revamp  
I *could* install some other thing, but the easier you make it for me to help you, the faster and more reliably I can do that.

I welcome all usage questions and improvement suggestions, especially to the documentation.
If something is unclear, or badly explained - please let me know.
